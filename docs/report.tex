\section{Summary}

\subsection{High Level Overview}
The world that will be modeled will be a simplified version of a Formula
1 (F1) car-racing season. This will include the drivers, the teams the
drivers are in, the races, and the results of those races. 

\subsection{Kinds of Data}
The kinds of data that will be stored will be about the drivers, the
teams, and the results that those drivers receive in the races that they
participate in. I'm not sure how in-depth you want me to go when
discussing kinds of data, but I think that the high level overview and
the ER diagram in the Logical Design section make it fairly clear the
kinds of data that I will be keeping track of. 

\subsection{Application Programs}
The application programs that are desired are a way to summarize the
results in a season, and determine who was the champion for that season.
I also want to look at the average results of each driver, and give a
summary of their best and worst races in a season (if I add data for
multiple seasons, then I will also be able to look at their results
across their career).

Each team will have two drivers, and I will have a way to compare the
drivers of one team. I will also have a way to look at the results of a
team over a season (the team's results is the sum of the results of its
drivers), and the results of that team over its tenure in F1.

\section{Physical Design}

Table names are in \textbf{bold and CAPITALIZED}, primary keys are
\myuline{underlined}, and foreign keys are \textit{italicized}. If an
attribute is a primary key and a foreign key, then it is
\myuline{\textit{underlined and italicized}}. Not
null requirements are indicated. Primary keys and foreign keys are
always not null.

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{TEAM}: \myuline{team\_id}, name, power\_unit, chasis
    \begin{itemize}
        \item not null: power\_unit, chasis

    \item \textbf{DRIVER}: \myuline{driver\_id},
    \textit{team\_team\_id}, code, number, fname, lname, dob
    \begin{itemize}

    \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{RESULT}: \myuline{\textit{race\_race\_id}},
    \myuline{\textit{race\_season\_year}}, \myuline{\textit{driver\_driver\_id}},

    date, name 
    \begin{itemize}
        \item not null: date, name
    \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{SEASON}: \myuline{year}

    length, n\_laps
    \begin{itemize}
        \item not null: name, lat, long, length, n\_laps
    \end{itemize}

\section{User's Guide}

\subsection{Basic Overview}

Each ``application'' is fairly straightforward to use. Most of the
applications display some variation of the results over a season.
Seasons are determined by the year, and the only season that has data is
2021. However, the complete data for every race and every result has
been entered for the 2021 F1 season, so every query for that season
should return a fairly ``well-stocked'' set of results.

The other fields are fairly picky about what is entered. If a field asks
for a ``Race,'' it wants that race's full name. The available races are:
\begin{multicols}{2}
\begin{itemize}
    \itemsep-0.1em
    \item Bahrain Grand Prix
    \item Emilia Romagna Grand Prix
    \item Portugese Grand Prix
    \item Spanish Grand Prix
    \item Monaco Grand Prix
    \item Azerbaijan Grand Prix
    \item French Grand Prix
    \item Styrian Grand Prix
    \item Austrian Grand Prix
    \item British Grand Prix
    \item Hungarian Grand Prix
    \item Belgian Grand Prix
    \item Dutch Grand Prix
    \item Italian Grand Prix
    \item Russian Grand Prix
    \item Turkish Grand Prix
    \item United States Grand Prix
    \item Mexico City Grand Prix
    \item Sao Paulo Grand Prix
    \item Qatar Grand Prix
    \item Saudi Arabian Grand Prix
    \item Abu Dhabi Grand Prix
\end{itemize}
\end{multicols}

The same goes for drivers, whose last names are:
\begin{multicols}{2}
\begin{itemize}
    \itemsep-0.1em
    \item Raikkonen
    \item Giovinazzi
    \item Gasly
    \item Tsunoda
    \item Alonso
    \item Ocon
    \item Vettel
    \item Stroll
    \item Leclerc
    \item Sainz
    \item Mazepin
    \item Schumacher
    \item Ricciardo
    \item Norris
    \item Hamilton
    \item Bottas
    \item Perez
    \item Verstappen
    \item Latifi
    \item Russell
    \item Kubica
\end{itemize}
\end{multicols}

And lastly, the same goes for the teams:

\begin{multicols}{2}
\begin{itemize}
    \itemsep-0.1em
    \item Mercedes-AMG Petronas F1 Team
    \item Red Bull Racing Honda
    \item Scuderia Ferrari
    \item McLaren F1 Team
    \item Aston Martin Cognizant F1 Team
    \item Alpine F1 Team
    \item Alfa Romeo Racing Orlen
    \item Scuderia AlphaTauri Honda
    \item Haas F1 Team
    \item Williams Racing
\end{itemize}
\end{multicols}

\subsection{Examples of Each Application}

Examples for each app are as follows:

    \includegraphics[scale=0.35]{1.PNG}
    \caption{This app displays the final driver standings of a season,
    by summing up the points that each driver has earned over the season
    and ordering the drivers based on total points earned.}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[scale=0.35]{2.PNG}
    \caption{This app displays the final team standings of a season,
    by summing up the points that each team has earned over the season
    and ordering the team based on total points earned. Because each
    team has two drivers, the points that a team earns in a race is the
    sum of the points of the drivers of that team.}
\end{figure}
\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[scale=0.35]{3.PNG}
    \caption{This app displays the driver standings after a race,
    showing their name, the position they finished in, and the points
    that they earned.}
\end{figure}
\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[scale=0.35]{4.PNG}
    \caption{This app displays the team standings after a race,
    showing their name, the position they finished in, and the points
    that they earned. The teams finishing position is determined by the
    points that the drivers of that team earned.}
\end{figure}
\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[scale=0.35]{5.PNG}
    \caption{This app displays, in chronological order across a season,
    the race results of one driver as well as the points that that
    driver earned.}
\end{figure}
\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[scale=0.35]{6.PNG}
    \caption{This app displays the average position per race and average
    points per race for every driver in a season, ordered from the highest
    average points to the lowest.}
\end{figure}
\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[scale=0.35]{7.PNG}
    \caption{This app displays information about every race that occurs
    in a season, including the race name, the circuit at which the race
    takes place, the date of the race, the length of the circuit, the
    number of laps, and the total length of the race. The results are
    ordered chronologically by race date.}
\end{figure}
\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[scale=0.35]{8.PNG}
    \caption{This app displays the two drivers in a team, mainly to
    compare the number of points that each driver has earned, but also
    showing their driver codes, their number, and the number of races
    they have completed. If a needed a replacement driver for some races
    during the season, that is displayed here (as is the case with Alfa Romeo).}
