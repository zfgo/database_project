\section{Summary}

\subsection{High Level Overview}
The world that will be modeled will be a simplified version of a Formula
1 (F1) car-racing season. This will include the drivers, the teams the
drivers are in, the races, and the results of those races. 

\subsection{Kinds of Data}
The kinds of data that will be stored will be about the drivers, the
teams, and the results that those drivers receive in the races that they
participate in. I'm not sure how in-depth you want me to go when
discussing kinds of data, but I think that the high level overview and
the ER diagram in the Logical Design section make it fairly clear the
kinds of data that I will be keeping track of. 

\subsection{Application Programs}
The application programs that are desired are a way to summarize the
results in a season, and determine who was the champion for that season.
I also want to look at the average results of each driver, and give a
summary of their best and worst races in a season (if I add data for
multiple seasons, then I will also be able to look at their results
across their career).

Each team will have two drivers, and I will have a way to compare the
drivers of one team. I will also have a way to look at the results of a
team over a season (the team's results is the sum of the results of its
drivers), and the results of that team over its tenure in F1.

\section{Physical Design}

Table names are in \textbf{bold and CAPITALIZED}, primary keys are
\myuline{underlined}, and foreign keys are \textit{italicized}. If an
attribute is a primary key and a foreign key, then it is
\myuline{\textit{underlined and italicized}}. Not
null requirements are indicated. Primary keys and foreign keys are
always not null.

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{TEAM}: \myuline{team\_id}, name, power\_unit, chasis
    \begin{itemize}
        \item not null: power\_unit, chasis
    \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{DRIVER}: \myuline{driver\_id},
    \textit{team\_team\_id}, code, number, fname, lname, dob
    \begin{itemize}
        \item not null: code, number, fname, lname
    \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{RESULT}: \myuline{\textit{race\_race\_id}},
    \myuline{\textit{race\_season\_year}}, \myuline{\textit{driver\_driver\_id}},
    \textit{points\_position}, fastest\_lap

    \item \textbf{POINTS}: \myuline{position}, points
    \begin{itemize}
        \item not null: points
    \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{RACE}: \myuline{race\_id},
    \myuline{\textit{season\_year}}, \textit{circuit\_circuit\_id},
    date, name 
    \begin{itemize}
        \item not null: date, name
    \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{SEASON}: \myuline{year}

    \item \textbf{CIRCUIT}: \myuline{circuit\_id}, name, lat, long,
    length, n\_laps
    \begin{itemize}
        \item not null: name, lat, long, length, n\_laps
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
