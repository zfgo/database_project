>   The purpose of this project is to step through both the design and
>   implementation phases of creating a database and appropriate
>   applications. The subject of your database should be of your own
>   choosing, either fictional or intended for actual use.      

### Assumptions
- you will work on your own
- you will use a MySQL server
- applications will be coded using PHP

### Deliverables
1. Cover page
1. Summary - This is a high level, English description of the mini-world
   to be modeled. This should include an informal discussion of the
   kinds of data to be stored and the application programs desired.
1. Logical design - ER diagram, either using Chen notation or Crowsfoot.
1. Physical design - A description of all tables and attributes.
1. List of Applications - A description of all the desired applications,
   which tables each effect, etc.
1. User's guide - How to use what you have implemented. We will look at
   each project, though you do not need to give a demo.
1. Contents of tables - A list of your tables and the contents of each.
   (Rather than inluding this in your report, it might be simplest to
   give a link from your project intro page.)
1. Implementation code It is nice to be able to look at your code. You
   could print it out, but it might make more sense to give links to it.
1. Conclusion Describe what you have done and what you would do if you
   had more time.
